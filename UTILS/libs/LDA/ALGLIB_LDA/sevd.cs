    Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix

    The algorithm finds eigen pairs of a symmetric matrix by reducing it to
    tridiagonal form and using the QL/QR algorithm.

    Input parameters:
        A       -   symmetric matrix which is given by its upper or lower
                    triangular part.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
        N       -   size of matrix A.
        IsUpper -   storage format.
        ZNeeded -   flag controlling whether the eigenvectors are needed or not.
                    If ZNeeded is equal to:
                     * 0, the eigenvectors are not returned;
                     * 1, the eigenvectors are returned.

    Output parameters:
        D       -   eigenvalues in ascending order.
                    Array whose index ranges within [0..N-1].
        Z       -   if ZNeeded is equal to:
                     * 0, Z hasn’t changed;
                     * 1, Z contains the eigenvectors.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
                    The eigenvectors are stored in the matrix columns.

    Result:
        True, if the algorithm has converged.
        False, if the algorithm hasn't converged (rare case).
