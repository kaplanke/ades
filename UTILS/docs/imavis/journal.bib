	tracking system which robustly handles several of the problems faced
	by previous lane tracking systems such as shadows on the road, unreliable
	lane markings, dramatic lighting changes and discontinuous changes

	is understandable that one of the main goals in the automotive industry
	is to increase vehicle safety. The European project SPARC (Secure
	Propulsion using Advanced Redundant Control) is developing the next
	generation of trucks that will fulfil these aims. The main technologies
	that will be used in the SPARC project to achieve the desiderated
	level of safety will be presented. In order to avoid accidents in
	critical situations, it is necessary to have a representation of
	the environment of the vehicle. Thus, several solutions using different
	sensors will be described and analysed. Particularly, a division
	of this project aims to integrate cameras in automotive vehicles
	to increase security and prevent driver's mistakes. Indeed, with
	this vision platform it would be possible to extract the position
	of the lane with respect to the vehicle, and thus, help the driver
	to follow the optimal trajectory. A definition of lane is proposed,
	and a lane detection algorithm is presented. In order to improve
	the detection, several criteria are explained and detailed. Regrettably,
	such an embedded camera is subject to the vibration of the truck,
	and the resulting sequence of images is difficult to analyse. Thus,
	we present different solutions to stabilize the images and particularly
	a new approach developed by the &quot;Laboratoire de Production Microtechnique&quot;.
	Indeed, it was demonstrated in previous works that the presence of
	noise can be used, through a phenomenon called Stochastic Resonance.
	Thus, instead of decreasing the influence of noise in industrial
	applications, which has non negligible costs, it is perhaps interesting
	to use this phenomenon to reveal some useful information, such as
	for example the contour of the objects and lanes.}

	of the most frequent causes of accidents. We examined situations
	in which experience might paradoxically impair detection and timely
	identification of traffic signs: when they are located in unexpected
	places.Hypothesis Experienced drivers have a well-learned schema
	for scanning the roadway, and will have difficulty detecting traffic
	signs when their location violates the expectations.Method Twenty
	experienced drivers were exposed briefly to pictures of real street
	and road scenes; some included #no##right-turn# (NRT) signs in the
	expected location (on the right curb) and some contained the same
	sign in an unexpected location (on the left curb). Participants'
	eye movements were recorded during the experiment.Results Drivers
	were less likely to identify the NRT sign when it was located at
	the unexpected location. Females were less sensitive to sign location
	and their performance was much better than that of males.Conclusions
	To increase their timely probability of identification, traffic signs
	should be posted in expected locations. Schema that drivers bring
	to the road enables them to handle large amounts of information,
	but the same schema can endanger drivers if traffic signs placement
	does not conform to the schema.Implications When signs are misplaced,
	crash causes can be due to inappropriate design, rather than inappropriate
	driving. Highway designers should ensure that their design conforms
	to standards that shape drivers' expectations.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The
	success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive
	set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must
	be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector
	while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution.
	We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges,
	and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals
	on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added
	to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge.
	We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors
	for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing
	the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty
	principle between detection and localization performance, which are
	the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator
	shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple
	approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in
	gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple
	detector using operators of several widths to cope with different
	signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method,
	called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information
	from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge
	detector performance improves considerably as the operator point
	spread function is extended along the edge.},

  abstract = {Lane boundary detection is the problem of estimating the geometric
	structure of the lane boundaries of a road based on the images grabbed
	by a camera on board a vehicle. We use the Hough transform to detect
	lane boundaries with a parabolic model under a variety of road pavement
	types, lane structures and weather conditions. In the three-dimensional
	Hough space, a parabolic curve is represented as a straight line.
	To simplify the computation, the parametric space can be divided
	into (i) a two-dimensional space measured by the parameters which
	are shared by all the lane edges, and (ii) a one-dimensional space
	of the parameter which makes a distinction among different edges
	in an image. A multiresolution strategy is used to improve both the
	speed and accuracy of the Hough transform. Experimental results show
	that the proposed method is relatively less prone to the image noise
	and is computationally tractable},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel lane detection algorithm for automatic
	drive system. The algorithm chooses a common curved lane parameter
	model which can describe both straight and curved lanes. The most
	prominent contribution of this paper is: instead of using one single
	method to calculate all the parameters in the lane model, both the
	adaptive random Hough transformation (ARHT) and the Tabu Search algorithm
	are used to calculate the different parameters in the lane model,
	according to the different demands of accuracy for different parameters.
	Furthermore, in order to reduce the time-consume of the whole system,
	the strategy of multi-resolution is proposed. At last, this paper
	also presents a tracking algorithm based on particle filter, which
	can make the system more stable. The algorithm presented in this
	paper is proved to be both robust and fast by a large amount of experiments
	in variable occasions, besides, the algorithm can extract the lanes
	accurately even in some bad illumination occasions.},
